# Finite State Machines - in React Native and Beyond



# Provided Resources

In most branches (i.e., for most course sections), you find the following folders in the repository branch:

- **`/code-a`**: Contains multiple subfolders with different code snapshots for this course section (also see [Using Code Snapshots](#using-code-snapshots))
- **`/demo`**: Contains multiple subfolders containing different code snapshots used during the course.
- **`/extra`**: Contains any extra files that were used (e.g., image assets that were used in the section)

# Using Code Snapshots

Code snapshots (which you find in `/code`) are there for you to compare your code to mine and find + fix errors you might have in your code.

# Running The Provided Code

The provided code is primarily meant to be used for code comparisons (i.e., so that you can compare your code to mine to find + fix errors). 

But you can also run my project code by navigating into the respective code snapshots subfolder (i.e., a subfolder in the `/code` folder) and executing `npm install` followed by `npm start` there.

Please note that dependency mismatches could lead to errors here, even if the provided code itself still works and is correct. In addition, you will always need to bring your own backend URLs (e.g., Firebase) or API keys, if any were used in the course section!

## Finite State Machine


---- In each exercise you start off with an environment setup, a package.json and the necessary information to run your project.
Each one will contain additional information if necesarry.

### 01 Up and Running - Exercise

**The Ask**

Build a finite state machine in the x-state visualizer editor and c

**Details**

**Acceptance Criteria**

- A complete state chart


**Restraints**

- The runner must finish the race, dead or alive.
- The *initial* state of the machine has to be set to 'running'
- There must be a mininum of 5 states 

**Deliverables**

- x-state visualizer example.
